<h3>Metroid</h3>

My Contributions: I contributed a great deal to this project as I was working on . For p1_milestone I implemented the running movement and the running jump behavior.
On top of this I also implemented the health, taking damage, collectables, the long beam powerup, player status ui, invincibility, zoomers and more.
Next for p1_alpha and p1_gold I completed all of the enviornment tasks, the miscellaneous tasks, and implemented skree, reo and zebs. Finally, for the new
level that my partner created I also implemented the custom mechanic we had which is the teleportation technique.

My Contributions: For this game the majority of my contributions focused on the actual gameplay. I helped build the functionality for the monkey and penguin tutorials specifically the robot movements
for them. I then also implemented the ability for the monkey to be able to climb trees. I spent a large portion of my time on level 2 where i helped design the level and implement the functionality
and playability of level 2. This includes things like the seesaw, the triggers, and the general gameplay flow. I also implemented the base running and jumping movement for all the characters in the game.
Additionally, I also worked on a multitude of bug fixes covering a vast array of topics like frictionless materials, non-deterministic behavior, spam-jumping, and much more.

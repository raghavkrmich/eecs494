<h3>Metroid</h3>

My Contributions: I contributed a great deal to this project as I was working on . For p1_milestone I implemented the running movement and the running jump behavior.
On top of this I also implemented the health, taking damage, collectables, the long beam powerup, player status ui, invincibility, zoomers and more.
Next for p1_alpha and p1_gold I completed all of the enviornment tasks, the miscellaneous tasks, and implemented skree, reo and zebs. Finally, for the new
level that my partner created I also implemented the custom mechanic we had which is the teleportation technique.
